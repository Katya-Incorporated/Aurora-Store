# Aurora Store: A Google Play Client 🌈 for Katya ® 👽 System!

## We intend to release our own open source operating system for desktop and mobile devices, where we will also focus on privacy and confidentiality, protection from listening to your calls, intercepting SMS and Internet traffic! 🤓 So, **Aurora Store** is an unofficial, FOSS client to Google's Play Store (like REChain.Store Client for [REChain 🪐 Pub](https://rechain.store/)) with an elegant design. Not only does Aurora Store download, update, and search for apps like the Play Store, it also empowers the user with new features. 🥰

For those concerned with privacy, **Aurora Store** does not require Google's proprietary framework (spyware?) to operate. It works perfectly fine with or without Google Play Services or [MicroG](https://microg.org/). 💡
